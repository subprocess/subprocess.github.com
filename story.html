		<h1>the raging inferno</h1>
		<h2>chapter 1 - deserted</h2>
		<p>The Doctor stepped out of the T.A.R.D.I.S. and looked around. He sniffed the air. His jacket and bow-tie twitched slightly due to the wind. Clara pushed her way past the Doctor, and soon became disappointed.</p>
		<p>"I'm assuming that this isn't the Third Moon..." started Clara.</p>
		<p>"The Third Moon of the Jalfreysie Constellation? No. It isn't." responded the Doctor briskly.</p>
		<p>"Actually, this very much looks like a desert." hypothesised Clara. Her bracelet jingled a little.</p>
		<p>"A desert? Yes. It does look a lot like a desert. It even <em>feels</em> like a desert. It <em>smells</em> like a desert," rambled The Doctor, "and in all actuality this may be a desert." The Doctor looked slightly disappointed, there was nothing but sand stretching until the horizon. Clara stood there, looking at The Doctor, while his ego shrunk slightly. The Doctor turned around and then said,</p>
		<p>"Aha! A city! I knew that we didn't come here for nothing!" The Doctor did something that may be referred to as a miniature dance, and strolled around to the other side of the T.A.R.D.I.S.. Clara followed The Doctor, wondering what he might have been referring to, and then she saw it. A majestic, beautiful, silver city sparkling in the middle of the desert. The sun reflected off of the towers and spires in the city, making it look as though the city was illuminating the desert. The Doctor quickly returned to the T.A.R.D.I.S. and came out with a bike soon afterward. He revved the engine a bit. Clara hopped on, and together they rode towards the city with sand splashing in every possible direction.</p>
		<p>As they approached the city, the first thing they saw was the lack of people. The second thing they saw was a sign. A quick scan with the sonic revealed that it was just a silver sign, with silver text painted on using silver paint.</p>
		<p>"Why is it silver paint on a silver sign?" asked Clara.</p>
		<p>"Well, maybe they just ran out of ink?" offered The Doctor as an answer. There was a certain uncertainty to his voice, and it slightly disturbed Clara. Everything in the city was silver, except for the floor, which was made of yellow sand. It crunched slightly under their feet. The Doctor walked up to one of the buildings nearby, and pushed the doors open. He glimpsed inside and immediately closed the doors. He glanced back in the direction of the T.A.R.D.I.S. to confirm that it was still there. The blue box was still there. He opened the silver doors again, slightly, and immediately closed them.</p>
		<p>"But... how?" murmured The Doctor to himself. Clara looked inquisitively at him.</p>
		<p>"What's there?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Oh, well... nothing of much importance..." lied The Doctor. Both Clara and The Doctor were silent. Clara noticed that The Doctor was stretching out the awkward silence to its limit. She started to walk toward the doors, but suddenly The Doctor blocked her way.</p>
		<p>"We must <em>not</em> go in there under <em>any</em> circumstance. Do you understand me?" said The Doctor, his eyes were a mix between fury, frustration, curiosity, and inquisitiveness. The Doctor then proceeded to open the doors, leap inside, and close them in one swift motion. Clara walked up closer to the doors. Suddenly they burst open and The Doctor flew out. The doors closed immediately afterward.</p><p>"Oh, it's you! Remember, don't press the green button, OK? Wait, it's not you, it's the other you!" fired off The Doctor. A hand the looked like Clara's, but missing her bracelet, emerged from the doors, grabbed The Doctor, and pulled him in. Clara waited approximately a minute. She pressed her ear up to one of the doors, and heard nothing. She peeked inside, it was empty. She went inside the doors, and they closed behind her with a soft thud.</p>
		<p>"Shhhhh!" whispered the bodiless voice of the Doctor, "be very, very quiet."</p>
		<p>"Where are you?" Clara whispered in return.</p>
		<p>"You know, I'm not exactly sure." said the Doctor in a rather loud voice. He was still nowhere to be seen. Clara jumped slightly at the volume.</p>
		<p>"Should I still be quiet?" whispered Clara.</p>
		<p>"Well... there's no particular need unless it's here, in which case &#8212;" the Doctor started, but then lapsed into silence.</p>
		<p>"Doctor?" timidly asked Clara, "Doctor?" The only reply was silence. Clara took some time to briskly look at her surroundings. The floor was a semi-soft carpet-floor mixture. It was a bland military gray. The walls were a slightly lighter gray, and seemed to be made of some sort of reflective plastic, giving the appearance of metal. The ceiling was just like the walls, except for six small indentations in a circular pattern. The room itself was square. A chill washed over Clara. Her bracelet jingled slightly.</p>
		<p>"Doctor?" said Clara, this time more a cry for help, rather than a questioning tone. Clara looked up at the six indentations. She could just barely reach them. After a few seconds, the started to slowly glow an orangy blue color. For a second clara thought she saw lightning.</p>
