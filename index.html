		<h2>chapter 1 - deserted</h2>
		<p>The Doctor stepped out of the T.A.R.D.I.S. and looked around. He sniffed the air. His jacket and bow-tie twitched slightly due to the wind. Clara pushed her way past the Doctor, and soon became disappointed.</p>
		<p>"I am assuming that this is not the Third Moon of the Jalfreysie Constellation. In fact, this looks like a desert. Care to explain?" asked Clara.</p>
		<p>"A desert? Yes. It does look a lot like a desert. It even <em>feels</em> like a desert. It <em>smells</em> like a desert," rambled The Doctor, "and in all actuality this may be a desert." The Doctor looked slightly disappointed, there was nothing but sand stretching until the horizon. Clara stood there, looking at The Doctor, while his ego shrunk slightly. The Doctor turned around and then said,</p>
		<p>"Aha! A city! I knew that we didn't come here for nothing!" The Doctor did something that may be referred to as a miniature dance, and strolled around to the other side of the T.A.R.D.I.S.. Clara followed The Doctor, wondering what he might have been referring to, and then she saw it. A majestic, beautiful, silver city sparkling in the middle of the desert. The sun reflected off of the towers and spires in the city, making it look as though the city was illuminating the desert. The Doctor quickly returned to the T.A.R.D.I.S. and came out with a bike soon afterward. Clara hopped on, and together they rode towards the city.</p>
		<p>As they approached the city, the first thing they saw was the lack of people. The second thing they saw was a sign. A quick scan with the sonic revealed that it was just a silver sign, with silver text painted on using silver paint.</p>
		<p>"What's the point of making a sign silver, if your only going to paint it using silver paint?" asked Clara.</p>
		<p>"Well, maybe they just ran out of ink?" offered The Doctor as an answer. There was a certain uncertainty to his voice, and it slightly disturbed Clara. Everything in the city was silver, except for the floor, which was made of yellow sand. It crunched slightly under their feet. The Doctor walked up to one of the buildings nearby, and pushed the doors open. He glimpsed inside and immediately closed the doors. He glanced back in the direction of the T.A.R.D.I.S. to confirm that it was still there. The blue box was still there. He opened the silver doors again, slightly, and immediately closed them.</p>
		<p>"But... how?" murmured The Doctor to himself. Clara looked inquisitively at him.</p>
		<p>"What's there?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Oh, well... nothing of much importance..." lied The Doctor. Both Clara and The Doctor were silent. Clara noticed that The Doctor was stretching out the awkward silence to its limit. She started to walk toward the doors, but suddenly The Doctor blocked her way.</p>
		<p>"We must <em>not</em> go in there under <em>any</em> circumstance. Do you understand me?" said The Doctor, his eyes were a mix between fury, frustration, curiosity, and inquisitiveness. The Doctor then proceeded to open the doors, leap inside, and close them in one swift motion. Clara walked up closer to the doors. Suddenly they burst open and The Doctor flew out. The doors closed immediately afterward.</p><p>"Oh, it's you! Remember, don't press the green button, OK? Wait, it's not you, it's the other you!" fired off The Doctor. A hand the looked like Clara's emerged from the doors, grabbed The Doctor, and pulled him in. Clara waited approximately a minute. She pressed her ear up to one of the doors, and heard nothing. She peeked inside, it was empty. She went inside the doors, and they closed behind her with a soft thud.
